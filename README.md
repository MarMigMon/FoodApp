## Considerations
1. What is your product pitch?
   - Start with a problem statement and follow up with a solution.
   - Focus on engaging your audience with a relatable need.
   The assumption is that people dislike interacting with their devices while cooking, as cooking tends to be hands-on and messy. However, nowadays, people commonly access recipes online, through such devices.
   Cooking is messy, and people like keeping their devices clean (and their food free of germs).
